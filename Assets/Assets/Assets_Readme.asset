    text: The Assets folder is where we keep all the important pieces we need to
      build our game. This includes pictures, models, textures, stuff for the game's
      environment, characters, UI, etc. It's the main place for anything visual or
      that we need to make the game world come alive.

    text: If you're working on animations, especially for characters or objects that
      move in 2D or 3D, this is also where you'll put the images or models before
      they are animated. But remember, this is different from the "Animation" folder.
      The "Animation" folder is just for the files that control how things move (like
      the animation data and controllers), not for the pictures or models themselves.
      So, put all the stuff we need to see and use in the game here, in the "Assets"
      folder. It helps us all find what we need quickly and keeps our project organized.
