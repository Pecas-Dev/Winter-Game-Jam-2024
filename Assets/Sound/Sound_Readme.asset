    text: "The Sound folder is designated for all our audio needs, including music
      tracks and sound effects (SFX) essential for enriching our game's atmosphere
      and immersive experience. To maintain optimal performance and compatibility
      with our Unity project, it\u2019s strongly encouraged to use the .ogg format
      for all sound files stored in this folder, although files like .mp3 or .wav
      are also fine. The .ogg format is preferred for its balance of quality and
      file size, making it ideal for ensuring the project is both high-quality and
      efficient."

  - heading: 
    text: Proper file naming is crucial in this folder. Each sound file should have
      a clear, descriptive name that accurately reflects its content or purpose within
      the game. A well-organized naming convention helps us quickly identify and
      access specific sounds, streamlining the development process and avoiding confusion.
      Please ensure your file names are complete, readable, and straightforward.
