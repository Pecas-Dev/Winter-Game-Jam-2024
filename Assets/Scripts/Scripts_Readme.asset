    text: The Scripts folder is where we store all the code that powers our game.
      These scripts are the backbone of the project, controlling everything from
      player movement, to game mechanics, to game systems, among other important
      things. It's crucial that we keep this folder organized and only make changes
      if you are sure about what we're doing.
