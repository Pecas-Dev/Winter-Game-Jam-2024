    text: This folder is designated for housing all Animation Assets and Animation
      Controllers. It serves as the central repository for the all the animations
      within the game. Within this folder, you'll find a structured collection of
      animation files, including both raw animation data and the controllers that
      manage the sequencing and blending of these animations [Animation and Animator
      Window]. The purpose is to streamline the development process by organizing
      these assets in a way that makes them easily accessible for integration and
      modification. Please ensure that all animation related files are stored here
      to maintain consistency and efficiency in our workflow.
