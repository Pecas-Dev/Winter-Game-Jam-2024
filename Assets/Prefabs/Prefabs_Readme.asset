    text: The Prefabs folder is for storing all prefab files. If you create a new
      prefab, please organize it into a specific subfolder, such as "Character" for
      character prefabs or "Environment" for environment prefabs, etc. If the right
      subfolder doesn't exist, feel free to create one. This helps keep our prefabs
      sorted and easy to find. Also, make sure to name your prefabs clearly to avoid
      any confusion. Keeping this folder organized is key for smooth development
      and collaboration.
